# Race_Distance_Calculator
Mini Java app that computes distance traveled from speed (km/h) and time (h), converts speed to m/s, and formats the output with String.format. It demonstrates primitive types, the KMH_TO_MS symbolic constant, and a separate calcularDistanciaKm method, includes simple validation to reject negative values, and performs no console input.
